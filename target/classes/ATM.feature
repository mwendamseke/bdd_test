Feature: ATM-1 Account Holder withdraws cash
  As an Account Holder
  I want to withdraw cash from an ATM
  So that I can get money when the bank is closed

  Scenario Outline: ATM-2 Account has sufficient funds
    Given the account balance is <account_balance>
    And the card is valid
    And the machine contains <atm_available>
    When the Account Holder requests <request>
    Then the ATM should dispense <result>
    And the account balance should be <newBalance>
    And the card should be returned

    Examples:
      | account_balance | atm_available | request | result | newBalance |
      | 1004            | 100           | 20      | 20     | 80         |
      | 1001            | 100           | 20      | 20     | 80         |
